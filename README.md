This project was developed to provide people with a free and open-source tool that offers security for their homes and businesses quickly and practically, without technical configurations and that works on PCs with Windows and Intel processors.

Installation is simple and you just need to run the "pv.exe" file and, through the graphical interface, perform the basic configuration, which consists of searching for IP cameras within the same network and defining a visual monitoring field.

It can be runned in MacOS, Linux and Windows, but the current "setup" is made only for Windows 10.
